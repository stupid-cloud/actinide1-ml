# Prediction of thermodynamic stability of actinide compounds by machine learning model 

This software package implements the random forest and neural network  to predict thermodynamic phase stability of actinide compounds . 

The package provides two major functions:

- Train  random forest and neural network model (training.ipynb).
- Predict Â the convex hulls  of new compositions with a pre-trained machine learning model (prediction.ipynb).



##  Prerequisites

This package requires:

- [matminer](https://hackingmaterials.lbl.gov/matminer)

- [scikit-plot](https://pypi.org/project/scikit-plot/)

- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

- [pymatgen](http://pymatgen.org)

- [qin-plot]((https://pypi.org/project/qin-plot/) )
